# Intro

I am a licensed structural engineer and also a passionate software developer. I currently work at AWS Lightsail as a Software Development Engineer, before which I used to work at Uzun+Case as a Project Engineer. I got my first master degree in civil engineering from University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, and my second master degree in computer science from Georgia Institute of Technology.  

Software development and buidling design share lots of similarities. Firstly, they have similar workflow. Both of them involve delivering a quality product to meet client's goals, from scratch, through multi-phase development and optimization, towards final output. Secondly, the development process takes a team to work both synchronously and asynchronously, where awareness of potential conflict and ability to coordinate are emphasized. Thirdly, both software development and building design require mastery of various software & tools, where self-learning and debugging on the fly are valued. Fourthly, clarity and attention to details are important to ensure product quality. Lastly, both are super fulfilling upon product delivery, either it is a gigantic building or a compact app.  

<!-- Moreover, nowadays, the technology and knowledge from the data & software fields are benefitting the traditional structural design more and more, as the automating power of software continuously shed light on most industries. When it comes to making decisions, we might still not feel super comfortable turning it over to a computer since it relates to safety. However, automating design workflow especially those regular and repetitive ones could not only enhance productivity, but potentially prevent inadvertent mistakes as well. Therefore, developing software and gadgets to solve problems interdisciplinarily becomes very appealing to me. -->
Moreover, software development plays a significant role in 3D building information modeling/analysis/designs by automating our daily engineering tasks, reducing repetitive work, enhancing productivity, and expediting project delievery process. Integrating knowledge from both fields and solving problems interdisciplinarily has become an essential skill nowadays.
